-- CODE GOALS --

the following two bugs only seem to happen on win7 x86 ??
  fix garbeled output for uuidgen and which
  fix slightly off values for wc

coreutils/head and coreutils/cat: read from stdin correctly (with no arg and with '-' as file)
coreutils/{mkdir,rmdir}: recursive directory creation/destruction (-p)
coreutils/mkdir: fix permission stuff (decimal to octal conversion ???)
coreutils/tac: actually work like tac (detailled methode in source)
reconsider implementing read,bg,fg (time will be implemented as dash shell doesn't have it)
which: extract arguments out of getopt like coreutils/cat (to allow '$ which ls -a sh -s mv' for example)
make programs that take options and filenames extract filenames in between options (wc,ls,..)
coreutils/wc: take multiple files like cat, if multiple files are provided, print total number of lines/chars/words as well
remove as much warnings as possible
coreutils/{dos2unix,unix2dos} (read stream of data and replace '\r\n' to '\n' and vice versa)
coreutils/mktemp: -t needs an argument
coreutils/tail
coreutils/printf
coreutils/tee
coreutils/groups
coreutils/test
customtools/read: check if variable was set correctly (check if input == getenv(variable))
customtools/strings.c: look for all individual strings instead of just printable characters by checking null byte after each printable character
coreutils/users
procutils/w
util-linux/nologin: if /etc/nologin.txt exists, print its contents
lib/util base64 encoding/decoding
coreutils/base32 encoding/decoding
customtools/exedump (support PE, ELF, and APE formats, format+arch autodetection ?, print properties / executable metadata like exe format version, linked libraries (if any), static/dynamic, min os version (PE only), interpreter(ELF only))
customtools/ascii check if a control code is provided as an argument (eg. ascii NUL -> dec 0 hex 0 oct 0 char NUL)
coreutils/uniq: store file into buf, split into lines, then for each line looks if all other lines are the same, then optimize
customtools/at
customtools/bg
customtools/fg
customtools/disown
coreutils/whoami fixes
coreutils/mknod
coreutils/id
util-linux/{mount,umount,mountpoint} (on Windows, use \\Device\Harddisk0\... or emulate /dev/sdXY)
customtools/time (use the portable posix format)
coreutils/cat fixes
coreutils/mv
coreutils/cp
coreutils/ls
coreutils/tr
coreutils/mktemp potential memory safety issues ?
sharutils/{uuencode,uudecode}
customtools/strings todos
coretuils/pwd todos (test on real Windows, not Wine)
coreutils/which Windows-specific fixes
coreutils/mkfifo
findutils/xargs
coreutils/dd (On Windows, provide /dev/zero, /dev/null, /dev/urandom, /dev/random emulation and possibly emulate /dev/sdXY)
procutils/sysctl (On Windows, do we provide the same linux interface translated to windows or do we create a command-line alternative to the control panel ?)
coreutils/env
iconv/iconv (use libicu ?)
make install target
allow to change installation prefix and destdir

create a test suite shell script
test building on netbsd

-- NON CODE GOALS --
improve readme a bit
create man pages for all utilities included
create a logo maybe ?
