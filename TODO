-- CODE GOALS --

exedump (support PE, ELF, and APE formats, format+arch autodetection ?, print properties / executable metadata like exe format version, linked libraries (if any), static/dynamic, min os version (PE only), interpreter(ELF only))
maybe add the file loading into a buffer from exedump, wc and strings into a function in util.c/h ? (since the buffer is just a pointer)
ascii: check if a control code is provided as an argument (eg. ascii NUL -> dec 0 hex 0 oct 0 char NUL)

mount, umount, mountpoint (on Windows, use \\Device\Harddisk0\... or emulate /dev/sdXY)
test building on netbsd
read
time
rev fixes
cat fixes
ls
tr
mktemp potential memory safety issues ?
uudecode/uuencode
strings todos
pwd todos (test on real Windows, not Wine)
base64
wc todos
which Windows-specific fixes
libutil pipe array removal (read directly from stdin)
mknod
mkfifo
xargs
dd (On Windows, provide /dev/zero, /dev/null, /dev/urandom, /dev/random emulation and possibly emulate /dev/sdXY)
sysctl (On Windows, do we provide the same linux interface translated to windows or do we create a command-line alternative to the control panel ?)

-- NON CODE GOALS --
improve readme a bit
create man pages for all utilities included
create a logo maybe ?
